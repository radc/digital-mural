# Digital Wall (React + Express)

This project is a **digital wall / kiosk app** built with **Create React App** and a small **Express.js backend**.  
It displays photos and videos in fullscreen, with configuration options (image duration, fit mode, schedules, etc.) defined in a `media.json` file.  
It also includes an **Admin panel** (`/admin`) where you can upload, delete, and configure media files remotely (login required).
